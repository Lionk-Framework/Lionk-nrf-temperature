# Zephyr BLE Temperature Sensor

This project is a Zephyr-based Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) application for Nordic Semiconductor (nRF) devices. It reads temperature and battery level, then transmits the data via BLE.

[![Build](https://github.com/Lionk-Framework/Lionk-nrf-temperature/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Lionk-Framework/Lionk-nrf-temperature/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Features

- BLE temperature and battery level service
- Lightweight application optimized for flash-constrained devices
- CI pipeline generates signed DFU packages for secure distribution
- Artifacts and releases available via GitHub Actions and Releases

---

## Firmware

### Official Releases

Signed firmware releases are available under [Releases](https://github.com/Lionk-Framework/Lionk-nrf-temperature/releases). These packages are cryptographically signed and ready for secure distribution.

### Intermediate Builds

CI-generated signed packages are available in the **GitHub Actions Artifacts** section. Each build produces a signed DFU package that can be used for secure firmware distribution.

## Build it yourself

This procedure was tested on a Fedora 41 Host PC.

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- openssl
- [nRF Util](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Util) with `nrf5sdk-tools` installed

### Generate a Signing Key

1. Generate a private signing key

```bash
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out priv.pem
```

### Build the application

We suggest using the same building process as the CI. This avoids having to install the build dependencies directly on your machine.
For this we'll use the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

1. Build the image

```bash
docker build -t nrf-connect-sdk .
```

2. Build the application using the image

```bash
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app nrf-connect-sdk
```

3. Inside `build/zephyr` you'll find:

- `zephyr.hex` - Contains the main application

### Create the application package

```bash
nrfutil nrf5sdk-tools pkg generate \
  --key-file priv.pem \
  --hw-version 52 \
  --sd-req=0x00 \
  --application build/zephyr/zephyr.hex \
  --application-version 1 \
  app_dfu_package.zip
```

### Flash the application

Flash the `build/zephyr/zephyr.hex` file directly to your nRF device using your preferred programming tool:

- **nRF Connect Programmer**: Load the hex file and flash to the device
- **J-Link**: Use `nrfjprog --program build/zephyr/zephyr.hex --chiperase --verify --reset`
- **OpenOCD**: Follow your device-specific OpenOCD configuration

Alternatively, if your device supports DFU mode, you can use the generated signed package:

```bash
nrfutil nrf5sdk-tools dfu usb-serial -pkg app_dfu_package.zip -p /dev/ttyACM0
```

## Security

* CI pipeline automatically signs all firmware packages using a secure signing key
* All generated DFU packages are cryptographically signed for secure distribution
* Signing ensures firmware authenticity and integrity
* Private signing keys are securely stored as GitHub repository secrets

---

## Notes

* This application has been optimized for flash-constrained devices
* Bootloader functionality has been removed from the main application to reduce flash usage
* Signed DFU packages are still generated by CI for secure firmware distribution
* The application can be flashed directly via programming tools or using DFU packages on compatible devices
